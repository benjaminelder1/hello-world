# hello-world
first repository on github, learning how to use the features

Hi github community,

My name is Ben. I am a senior at Notre Dame majoring in Business Analytics. I am an aspiring data scientist/software developper who enjoys codeing in Python and R. I am creating this initial repository as an assignment for my unstructured analytics course.
